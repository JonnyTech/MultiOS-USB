After the installation, enable Secure Boot.

Windows ISO images are larger than 4GB, please use exFAT instead of fat32 when installing MultiOS-USB.

If you want to install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware, you can manually apply the attached registry
entries before starting the installation. On the welcome screen (language selection), press Shift+F10.
In the command prompt, type:

	regedit c:\MultiOS-USB\config\windows\windows11-bypass.reg

and confirm adding the file to the registry (if necessary, change the drive letter from c: to d:, e:, etc.).
Return to the welcome screen and continue with the installation.

Instead of the regedit command, you can launch

	notepad

and add the reg file to the registry from the graphical interface.
Remember to enable showing all files in Notepad!
